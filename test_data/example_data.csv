1,1,"We tend to go to the beach every year for my birthday. I don’t really remember the location. But I was probably ten years old, because I think we were with my childhood friend john. There are always people laying on the sand, so I assume there are in this memory too. This memory makes me want to go to the beach now."
2,1,I remember laying on the sand. I had a cold beer next to me. The sky was light blue. I saw no clouds. I hear the sound of the ice cream truck coming by. I am happy. My brother is sitting next to me. We are chatting. We pull out some sandwiches and eat them. I wish my days now were as carefree as they were then.
